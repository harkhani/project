 <p style="padding: 16px; font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5;">Valley of Flowers is a legendary trek. The world knows of it! Many tales have been spun around this valley – usually about trekkers falling unconscious from the heavy scent of flowers on the valley floor. The beginnings of these tales were made by British mountaineer Frank Smythe, who stumbled upon this valley after a hard climb of Mt Kamet. “The most beautiful valley I had ever seen among the most noblest and purest mountains on earth” is how he put it in his book.   That might sound like an extravagant description, but you would find it difficult to disagree.</p> <br/>
